For my daughter's kindergarten project fair, I pitched the idea of working on a robot together after a comment a few weeks earlier that she really, really *really* wanted a robot that could clean her room for her birthday. That's above my head, so we just put together various combinations of sensors and outputs from an Adafruit Arduino starter/sensor kit I had.

Her name is "Violet," and her she is!

I wrote about the experience on my [blog](link) if you'd like to see more about my thoughts on working together and our build process.

I added the code, which was written hastily on a deadline, so forgive it's messy and non-optimized state. Having so many inputs/outputs did get me to stumble on [Adafruit's awesome articles on multitasking](https://learn.adafruit.com/multi-tasking-the-arduino-part-1/overview), which introduced me to the concept of writing objects instead of cramming everything into `loop()`. Definitely a valuable lesson!

I'm still working on a video of Felicity talking about and demonstrating Violet, which I hope to post in the next week.
